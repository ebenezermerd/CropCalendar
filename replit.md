# Crop Calendar Gantt Export Tool

### Overview
The Crop Calendar Gantt Export Tool is a professional-grade application designed to process agricultural data, visualize crop seasonality, and prepare it for export. It streamlines the workflow from raw file upload to interactive Gantt chart visualization, focusing on robust data parsing, intelligent column mapping, and flexible filtering. The tool aims to provide a clear, interactive overview of crop planting, growing, and harvesting periods, enabling detailed analysis and future export capabilities.

### User Preferences
No explicit user preferences were provided in the original `replit.md` file.

### System Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it provides a professional, responsive user interface with a multi-step workflow. Key UI/UX decisions include drag-and-drop interfaces, color-coded data previews, interactive Gantt charts with zoom and tooltips, and a clean, modern design.
- **Backend**: Implemented with FastAPI and Uvicorn, handling data processing, column auto-detection, parsing, and filtering logic.
- **Database**: SQLite is used for storing upload metadata, user-configured mappings, and normalized parsed records.

**Core Features and Design Decisions:**
- **File Handling**: Supports CSV, XLSX, XLS, and XML formats with validation for type and size (50MB limit).
- **Intelligent Auto-Detection & Column Mapping**: Server-side auto-detection identifies 9 column types (agricultural + temporal) using keyword matching and value analysis with confidence scoring. Users can customize mappings via an interactive UI.
- **Robust Parsing & Normalization**: Extracts month/season information (e.g., "Jan-Mar", "3-5", "All year") and generates 12-bit month masks for efficient querying. Manual review flags assist with unparseable values.
- **Group Selection & Filtering**: Allows users to filter data by any column, offering fuzzy search, bulk selection, and presentation of both raw and parsed results.
- **Interactive Gantt View**:
    - **Multi-column Grouping**: Users can select multiple columns to create hierarchical groupings (e.g., Country + Period + Crop).
    - **Month-grid Visualization**: Displays crop periods on a 12-month X-axis, with grouped records on the Y-axis.
    - **Dynamic Display**: Visual rectangles generated from month masks, color-coded for visual distinction, with year-end wrapping for spans like Dec-Jan.
    - **Interactivity**: Includes zoom controls (Month/Quarter view), hover tooltips for date ranges, and inline editing of month masks.
